# Waste Management Using CNN Model

This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of waste into different categories such as organic and recyclable. The aim is to assist in automated waste segregation, which is crucial for efficient waste management and recycling processes.

## Project Overview

The **Waste Management Using CNN Model** project aims to improve waste management processes by using machine learning to automate the classification of waste. The project involves:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to preprocess and normalize the dataset.
- **Model Architecture**: A CNN model designed to effectively classify waste images.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the CNN model and evaluating its performance on validation data.
